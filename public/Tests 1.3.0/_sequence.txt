preview tests
    SFPG
        complex preview
            build a rather complex SFPG file: called preview1
            new file
            open preview1
            preview the file - all sounds should be heard and genertors highlighted as performed
            solo a track
            preview - only that track should be heard
            preview a single generator - only that generator should be heard

    SFRG
        create a SFPG generator on one track with a constant repeated single note
        save it to preview2
        preview the file - expect sound should be heard
    Noise
        create two Noise generators - one white and one gaussian
        save to preview3
        previle file - expected sound show be heard
